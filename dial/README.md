# Dial

The "dial" script is a Bash script that takes a dialing code as an integer and outputs the corresponding country code.

## Usage

1. Make sure the script has executable permissions. If not, run the following command:
   ```
   chmod +x dial
   ```

2. Execute the script with the desired dialing code as the argument:
   ```
   ./dial <dialing_code>
   ```

   Replace `<dialing_code>` with the desired dialing code in integer format.

## Example

To find the country code for dialing code 1, execute the following command:
```
./dial 1
```
