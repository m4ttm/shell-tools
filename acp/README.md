# ACP (Add, Commit, Push) Script

The ACP (Add, Commit, Push) script is a simple shell script that automates the process of adding, committing, and pushing changes to a Git repository. It provides a convenient way to quickly stage and push your changes with a commit message.

## Usage

To use the `acp` script, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository or download the `acp` file.
2. Make the script executable by running `chmod +x acp`.
3. Place the `acp` script in a directory that is included in your system's `$PATH` environment variable, or provide the full path when executing the script.

Once you have the script set up, you can run it using the following command:

```bash
acp "Commit message"
